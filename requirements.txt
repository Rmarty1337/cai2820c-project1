After creating the `requirements.txt` file, you can install all the dependencies by running:

```sh
pip install -r /Users/roby/Documents/Programs/Project-1/requirements.txt
```

This should resolve the `ModuleNotFoundError` and ensure that all necessary libraries are installed.

To resolve the error during the installation of requirements, you should check the terminal for specific error messages. However, I can suggest a few common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Ensure you have the correct Python version**: Some libraries may require a specific version of Python. Make sure you are using a compatible version.

2. **Check for typos in `requirements.txt`**: Ensure that all package names are spelled correctly.

3. **Install dependencies individually**: Try installing each dependency one by one to identify which one is causing the issue.

If you encounter an error, please provide the specific error message from the terminal for further assistance.

To summarize, the `requirements.txt` file ensures that all the required libraries are installed in the environment where your Streamlit app runs. This helps prevent `ModuleNotFoundError` and other dependency-related issues.
